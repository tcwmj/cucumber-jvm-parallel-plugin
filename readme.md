cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin ![CI status](https://travis-ci.org/temyers/cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin.svg?branch=master)
============================

A common approach for running Cucumber features in parallel is to create a suite of Cucumber runners, one for each suite of tests you wish to run in parallel.  For maximum parallelism, there should be a runner per feature file.

This is a pain to maintain and not very DRY.

This is where the cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin comes in.  This plugin automatically generates a Cucumber JUnit or TestNG runner for each feature file found in your project.

Usage
-----

Add the following to your POM file:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.yiwan</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${cucumber.jvm.parallel.plugin.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>generateRunners</id>
            <phase>validate</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>generateRunners</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <!-- Mandatory -->
                <!-- comma separated list of package names to scan for glue code -->
                <glue>com.lombardrisk.glue.hooks,com.lombardrisk.glue.steps</glue>
                <!-- These are the default values -->
                <!-- Where to output the generated tests -->
                <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/generated-test-sources/cucumber</outputDirectory>
                <!-- The directory containing your feature files.  -->
                <featuresDirectory>src/test/resources/features/</featuresDirectory>
                <!-- Directory where the cucumber report files shall be written  -->
                <cucumberOutputDir>${project.build.directory}/result/cucumber-reports</cucumberOutputDir>
                <!-- comma separated list of output formats -->
                <format>json,html,rerun</format>
                <!-- CucumberOptions.strict property -->
                <strict>true</strict>
                <!-- CucumberOptions.monochrome property -->
                <monochrome>true</monochrome>
                <!-- The tags to run, maps to CucumberOptions.tags property -->
                <tags>"~@manual", "~@deprecated", "~@todo", "~@wip", "~@ignore"</tags>
                <!-- If set to true, only feature files containing the required tags shall be generated. -->
                <!-- Excluded tags (~@notMe) are ignored. -->
                <filterFeaturesByTags>true</filterFeaturesByTags>
                <!-- Generate TestNG runners instead of JUnit ones. -->
                <useTestNG>true</useTestNG>
                <!--cucumber TestNG super test class, default value is cucumber.api.testng.AbstractTestNGCucumberTests-->
                <testNGSuperClass>cucumber.api.testng.AbstractTestNGCucumberTests</testNGSuperClass>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

If `cucumber.options` VM argument is specified as per the [Cucumber CLI options](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm), they shall override the configuration tags.

Where glue is a comma separated list of package names to use for the Cucumber Glue.

The plugin will search `featuresDirectory` for `*.feature` files and generate a JUnit test for each one. If you prefer to generate TestNG tests, set `useTestNG` to true

The Java source is generated in `outputDirectory`, and will have the pattern `ParallelXXIT.java`, where `XX` is a one up counter.

Each runner is configured to output the results to a separate output file under `target/cucumber-parallel`

FAQ
===
Q. Why isn't there much activity on this project
A. The plugin is considered feature complete.  If you feel there is something missing, raise an issue.

Changelog
=========

-----
* pr#13 - Added support for generating TestNG runners.
* pr#14 - Added support for generating TestNG runners with name from counter to the same feature file name in Camel case.
* pr#15 - Added support for generating TestNG runners with specified super testng class.

1.0.1
-----
* issue#10 - compilation error on Windows.
* issue#7 - Added support for filtering generated files by tag.
* Added support for cucumber.options command line arguments.

Contributing
============

To contribute:

* Create an integration test to demonstrate the behaviour under `src/it/`.  For example, to add support for multiple output formats for junit runners:
    * Create src/it/junit/multiple-format
    * copy the contents of the src/it/junit/simple-it directory and update the pom/src as appropriate to demonstrate the configuration.  Update the verify.groovy to implement the test for your feature.
    * Run `mvn clean install -Prun-its` to run the integration tests.
* Implement the feature
* When all tests are passing, submit a pull request.

Once the pull request has been merged, a new release will be performed as soon as practicable.
